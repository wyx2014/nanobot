# Tool Usage Notes

Tool signatures are provided automatically via function calling. This section documents the general tool contract and non-obvious usage patterns.

## General Tool Contract

- Use the narrowest structured tool that directly matches the task.
- Use read-only discovery before writes when state is uncertain.
- Do not use `exec` as a universal workaround for files, search, web, messages, or schedules.
- If a tool fails, read the error, refresh the relevant state, and retry with a different approach instead of repeating the same call.
- After meaningful changes, verify with the smallest reliable check: re-read changed state, run targeted tests, or inspect command output.
- Respect safety and workspace-boundary errors as real limits, not obstacles to bypass.

## Discovery and Reading

- Use `find_files` or `list_dir` to locate workspace paths before `read_file` when a path is uncertain.
- Use `grep` for content search inside the workspace; prefer it over shell grep for ordinary searches.
- `grep` defaults to `output_mode="files_with_matches"`; use `output_mode="content"` for matching lines with context.
- Use `fixed_strings=true` for literal keywords containing regex characters.
- Use `output_mode="count"` to size a broad search before reading full matches.
- Use `head_limit` and `offset` to page across large result sets.
- Binary or oversized files may be skipped to keep results readable.

## File and Coding Workflows

- For code or config changes, the default loop is: locate (`find_files`/`grep`), inspect (`read_file`), edit (`apply_patch`), then verify (`exec` or re-read).
- Use `apply_patch` as the default code editing tool, especially for multi-file changes, structural edits, generated code, moves, adds, or deletes.
- Use `apply_patch dry_run=true` when the patch is uncertain and you want validation plus a change summary before writing.
- Use `edit_file` only for small exact replacements in one file, with `old_text` copied from `read_file`; add `occurrence`, `line_hint`, or `expected_replacements` when ambiguity matters.
- Use `write_file` for new files or intentional full-file rewrites, not routine partial edits.
- If `apply_patch` or `edit_file` fails, re-read with `force=true`, narrow the context, and try a smaller patch rather than switching to shell `sed` or `echo`.

## Process Execution

- Use `exec` for tests, builds, package commands, git commands, and other process execution.
- Prefer dedicated file/search tools over `cat`, shell `find`, shell `grep`, `sed`, or `echo` for ordinary workspace inspection and edits.
- Use non-interactive flags such as `-y` or `--yes` when available.
- Commands have a configurable timeout (default 60s), dangerous commands are blocked, and output is truncated.
- For long-running or interactive commands, pass `yield_time_ms`; if the process keeps running, continue with `write_stdin`.
- Use `write_stdin` to poll, provide stdin, close stdin, wait for expected output with `wait_for`, or terminate an existing exec session.
- Use `list_exec_sessions` to recover active session IDs after context shifts.

## CLI App Attachments

- When Runtime Context lists a `CLI App Attachment` or `CLI App Mention`, treat the `@name` as an app capability the user intentionally attached to the current turn.
- If the task may need app-specific behavior, read the listed skill first, then call `run_cli_app` with that `name`.
- Do not run an attached CLI app through shell or generic process tools unless the user explicitly asks for that lower-level path.
- If the app CLI is missing, lacks local desktop/app/API prerequisites, or cannot complete the requested action, explain that concrete blocker and what was attempted.

## Web and External Information

- Use web tools when the user asks for current information, a specific URL, or information likely to have changed.
- Use `web_search` to find sources and `web_fetch` for a specific page or result that needs closer reading.
- Do not invent freshness-sensitive facts when tools can verify them.

## Messaging and Media

- Use `message` to send content or local media to the user/channel.
- Use `request_user_input` only when a WebUI chat is missing required information and a short structured choice is the fastest way to unblock the task.
- When the user explicitly invites you to ask one or two key clarification questions before you begin, and required information is still missing, prefer `request_user_input` on the first turn instead of replying with a plain-text question or drafting a partial answer.
- In WebUI, if a short structured clarification card would clearly work better than a free-form follow-up question, use `request_user_input` rather than asking in normal prose.
- Before asking, evaluate all missing required information. Greedily choose at most two most blocking independent questions for one `request_user_input.questions` card; if two independent questions are not available, ask one.
- Never split two independent initial questions into consecutive `request_user_input` cards.
- Use a second interactive prompt round only when the next question genuinely depends on the user's previous interactive-prompt answer; set `depends_on_previous_answer=true` for that second call.
- Use at most two interactive prompt rounds in one session/task. After two rounds, ask any remaining clarification in normal text instead of calling `request_user_input` again.
- Do not include "Other", "Something else", "Custom", or equivalent fallback choices in `request_user_input` options; WebUI always provides a freeform input row for every question.
- Do not use `request_user_input` for scheduled runs, open-ended brainstorming, or information you can infer safely.
- `read_file` only reads content for your analysis; it does not deliver a file to the user.
- When sending an existing local file, attach it through the message/media mechanism instead of pasting file contents unless the user asked for text.

## Scheduling and Background Work

- Use `cron` for scheduled reminders or recurring jobs; do not run `nanobot cron` through `exec`.
- For heartbeat tasks, update `HEARTBEAT.md`; the default gateway heartbeat cron job handles periodic checks when enabled.
- Do not write reminders only to memory files when the user expects an actual notification.
